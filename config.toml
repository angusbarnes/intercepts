# This is a TOML file
# Lines starting with a # are comments and do not affect
# anything. They are simply notes.

# Some things you should know about TOML:
#       - Text fields must be wrapped in quotes: 'text'
#       - Lists get wrapped in square brackets and items
#         in them are seperated by commas
# list_of_text_fields = ['example', 'text']

# WHEN EDITING THIS FILE, ONLY EDIT THINGS ON THE RIGHT
# SIDE OF AN ASSIGNMENT (ONLY THE STUFF AFTER AN EQUALS SIGN)
